          "<p>Project that working method becomes everything more common in soon said all social sectors, and project management become thereby a common task for everything several employees in both companies and administration, in both continuous activities that research and development. In practice, most of today´s science and technology students will somehow be involved in project-based work within only a few years after graduation from higher education. Several of the largest employers of recent engineering graduates have completely or partly changed to be project-based organisations, which suggets that daily production is also organised as projects.</p><p>The emergence of projects as a central working method is mirrored by an even clearer 'professionalisation' of the project manager role. Those who continuously have the responsibility for large industrial projects are often professional project managers, and they have in addition to their first-cycle studies also a deep understanding of so-called project management theory, which is the research-oriented basis of the project work. Project management theory includes many models that can be used for successful generation organisation, management and team leadership of/in projects. These models must be used at the same time with assessment and reflection. Recent research in project management, for which the Department left lndustrial Economics and Organisation is nationally and internationally renowned, emphasises therefore also the importance of leadership, organisation, ethics and a sustainable working environment in the development of industrial project work. Accordingly, this course focuses on giving the students understanding of how project management is developed, documented and spread in the interplay between academic research and practical applications.</p><p>The course focuses on management and working methods in business, development and innovation projects in technology-intensive companies. During the course, the research-based project management theory is combined with case studies from different technology-intensive sectors and research and development work. Strong emphasis is placed on how the surrounding conditions influence the project management as well as at the role of the client.</p>",
